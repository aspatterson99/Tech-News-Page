## Overview
  This is a newspage website. I used it to practice positioning, importing fonts from google, and importing images from files.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- VS Code
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles



### What I learned

I learned how to add and style multiple images to this project by putting each image in a class. I also learned that each image needs an "alt" element in case it does not load correctly. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<img class = "imagemain" src = "assets/images/image-web-3-desktop.jpg"
      alt="Geometric Shapes">
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```


### Continued development

I want to continue to workon positioning. When I move an image or a dev box sometimes it moves other elements. I feel like there is a better way to add elements and position them.
